This code is almost identical to karpathy's nanoGPT so I would start by forking that instead of attempting to develop from here.

I used the following commands to train the LLM Caissa:

# Preparing training data
python data/chess-data/prepare.py

# Training LLM on data
python -u train.py config/train_caissa.py

# Sample LLM without prompt
python sample.py --out_dir=out-caissa

# Sample LLM with text prompt
python sample.py --start="FILE:./prompts/sample_M1_puzzle.txt" --out_dir=out-caissa
