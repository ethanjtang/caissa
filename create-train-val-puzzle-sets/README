# Preconditions

Make sure to download the puzzles from Lichess's open-source database into a .CSV file:
https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles
There are also many paths you will need to change because I kept nesting folders to "stay organized" during development.

# extract_puzzles.py

Run to extract puzzles into an aggregated training set and validation sample sorted by puzzle theme.
Note that each puzzle theme may have more than the minimum puzzles allocated for it since puzzles can have multiple themes.

# clean_training_puzzles.py

Run to remove <puzzle-start/> and <puzzle-end/> tags from training set.

# remove_duplicates.py

Run to remove duplicate FENs from training data that are found in validation directory files.

# validate_trainval_sets.py

Run this to ensure that training and validation puzzle sets do not share any positions in common.

# analyze_puzzle_token_count.py

Run to analyze size of context window to capture a single chess position.

# count_number_of_puzzles

Run to analyze the number of puzzles or number of puzzle positions in a specific file or directory.
